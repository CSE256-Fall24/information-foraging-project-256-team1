      <h3>Orientation</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Before the school year begins, each family will receive information in August that includes an
orientation day for families. This visiting day allows the child and parent(s) to visit the 
classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour long. It will allow
time for the child to enjoy free play and also give parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect
during the school year. The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own. The class is
divided in half, attending on two different days. This schedule allows the children and
teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends at the end of the first
week.
