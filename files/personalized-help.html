      <h1>Personalized Help for Your Child</h1>
      <p>
        Are you concerned that your child wouldn't receive the support they need in the nursery school?
      </p>
      <h2>
        Adapting to Students in Learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:

        Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the childâ€™s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence
        Offering more opportunities for exploration
        Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
        Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
        Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process
        Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern
      </p>
      <h3>Transition</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Before the school year begins, each family will receive information in August that includes an
orientation day for families. This visiting day allows the child and parent(s) to visit the 
classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour long. It will allow
time for the child to enjoy free play and also give parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect
during the school year. The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own. The class is
divided in half, attending on two different days. This schedule allows the children and
teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends at the end of the first
week.
