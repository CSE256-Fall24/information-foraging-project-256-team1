      <h1>Personalized Help for Your Child</h1>
      <p>
        Are you concerned that your child wouldn't receive the support they need in the nursery school?

      <h2>
        Adapting to Students in Learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:

        Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the childâ€™s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence
        Offering more opportunities for exploration
        Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
        Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
        Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process
        Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern
      </p>
